1	Upper Andi	Andi	village	yes	yes	R=gu	emphatic particle	Origin of the numeral marker	Origin of the numeral marker	cercvadze1965	345	"In numerals from 21 to 99 -lo-gu is used in between decimals and ones (č'ec'ol-lo-gu-č'e-gu '22'). According to the source, -lo-gu- means 'with', so '22' is 'twenty with two'. Apparently, usually in Andi =gu can appear in a compound numeral more than once. This is not true for Rikvani Andi.
In compound numerals from 11 to 19 genitive/locative marker is used on decimals: hoc'oƛi-se-b '11'. In Zilo village, dative marker is used instead of genitive (hoc'olɬ:ij-), in villages Muni and Kvankhidatli another stem of unknown origin is used (hoc'ol[i]). «В мунибском говоре <…> выделяется классный суффикс в числительном лъо-йи (I-II кл.), лъо-ви (III кл.) ‘три’» [alekseevetal1998: 228]."

In RIkvani Andi in compound numerals =gu can be used only once, at the end of the whole numeral. Unlike in Gagatli Andi, in Rikvani Andi =gu cannot appear in the middle of a compound numeral (for example, чIецIолло сев '21'; гьочIоцIолло сев '91'). In compound numerals from 21 to 99 (except for 30, 40, … 90) =gu is replaced by suffix -lo (č'e-c'ol=gu '20' but č'e-c'ol-lo se-w '21').
In compound numerals from 11 to 19 genitive marker is used on decimals: hoc'o-ƛ se-w '11' (ten-GEN one-M). Hence, when inflecting hoc'o=gu '10' by genitive, =gu is similarly omitted: hoc'o-ƛ (ten-GEN) [suleymanov1957: 306]. It is unclear whether =gu stays during inflection of other numerals and cases, as [suleymanov1957: 312—314] uses se-w '1' as an example to show inflection patterns.

=gu is not used with miljan 'million', borrowed from Russian (милйан 'one million'). However, when counting millions, =gu is used with the number of millions (инштугу милйан 'five millions').

It seems from the examples that =da appears only once in cardinals, at the end of a compound numeral (for example, k'a:-c'a=da '20' but k’a:-c’a-li k’e-da '22'). Compound numerals are derived with the suffix -ɬi, the source of which «is probably the Dative marker -li».

When nominalised the cardinal numbers inflect according to the i-declension, except the numeral 2. Similar to other compound terms, in compound cardinals only the second part inflects according to i-declension» [120].	Maksim Melenchenko	2022-08-19	hing	hing	5	five		five	dum-tragut2009	118
