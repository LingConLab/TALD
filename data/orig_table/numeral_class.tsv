In fast colloquial speech class marker -CM is often omitted. Unlike in Southern Akhvakh, -da cannot be omitted [41]. Apparently, -da and class marker do not repeat in a complex numeral and appear only on the end of it [examples on page 71]. Ordinals inflect the way adjectives do [72]. =da appears in azaro-da '1000', as shown by [creisselsdraft2020: 17] (no mentions of millions and larger). The -da-CM-e might originate in participle ida-CM-e 'being' [67].
Confusion: [magomedbekova1967: 41] mentions that in Southern Akhvakh cardinals do not inflect by class. It is unclear whether she means that the -CM-e suffix is absent in these cardinals. No examples are given. [creisselsdraft2020: 16], however, mentions the same thing (-CM is absent) but attributes this feature to Northern Akhvakh. ffix.
