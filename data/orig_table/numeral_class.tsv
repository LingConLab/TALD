It appears in all cardinals except the ones that end with če-CM '1', including it itself [magomedovaabdulaeva2007: 686]. In fast colloquial speech class marker -CM is often omitted. Unlike in Southern Akhvakh, -da cannot be omitted [41]. Apparently, -da and class marker do not repeat in a complex numeral and appear only on the end of it [examples on page 71]. Ordinals inflect the way adjectives do [72]. =da appears in azaro-da '1000', as shown by [creisselsdraft2020: 17] (no mentions of millions and larger). The -da-CM-e might originate in participle ida-CM-e 'being' [67].
Confusion: [magomedbekova1967: 41] mentions that in Southern Akhvakh cardinals do not inflect by class. It is unclear whether she means that the -CM-e suffix is absent in these cardinals. No examples are given. [creisselsdraft2020: 16], however, mentions the same thing (-CM is absent) but attributes this feature to Northern Akhvakh. He gives many examples, all of them without class suffix. Also, [creisselsdraft2020: 17] shows examples of ordinals without the class marker which is present in [magomedovaabdulaeva2007: 687].

The class marker is always in the end, and it is present in all numerals up to 1000 and even 100 000. There is no evidence of numerals which do not have this class marker. II, IV-class consonant /r/ is said to correspond with /d/ in the beginning of words. This -da appears in '1000' азарда, where -ra dissimilates with final /r/ of the root and becomes /d/ [56].

It is marked by a-CM-u when the short form (stem) ends with a consonant, and by ej-CM-u when it ends with a vowel. Exception: qI'˳e 'two' makes class forms qI'˳ewu (I), qI'˳eru (II). Also, os '1' does not receive class marker but it has a special form when impure: sej-CM-u (for example, in '31') [mikailov1967: 74]. There is also a so-called «full form» of a cardinal, which is derived from the stem with the suffix -(t̄)or, which is plural marker for substantives. Units do not have this marker (it is said that the short form, a.k.a stem, and the full form of cardinals coincide for units.) -or is «characteristic» for moč'or '10' and boIš̄or '100' (I guess it means that this suffix is used only for these numerals, and -t̄or is used for others). In complex numerals, the last unit is in a class form, and the other digits are in full forms (for example, x̌̄o boIš̄-or x̌̄˳-ej-t'-u '505' [120]). More info in [chumakina2021: 462].

In morpheme -цIу-р, which marks numerals 30—90, class marker is frozen as -r (хьу-цIу-р '50' glossed as 'five-ten-CM'). However, [magometov1965: 160] is rather inconsistent in terms of whether class marker here is frozen or not. In hundreds, class marker is attached to the number of hundreds but not to the hundreds themselves. Apparently, it's always -d in that position (for example, шубу-д-варж '300' glossed as 'three-CM-hundred'). The same goes for thousands. [alekseevetal1998: 369 (in the file)] notes about this: «Наблюдается также тенденция к утрате классных показателей – десятки, начиная с тридцати, классов не различают: сумцIур кас ‘тридцать человек’, сумчIур пеъ ‘тридцать куриц’, сумчIур йигъ ‘тридцать дней’». Numerals варж '100' and агъзур '1000' do not inflect by class. (Unclear if they used to, probably not…) In dialects of Tabasaran there are differences in inflection of numerals. When substantivized, cardinals inflect by case like nouns. Class marker is present, case suffixes attach after it [magometov1965: 160].

Числительные 1, 100, 1000, 1000000 не имеют в своем составе ни классного показателя, ни морфемы =le.

Tens 30—90 do not have =CM(=le) either [155]. But =CM is also used in denoting the number of hundreds, thousands, etc. (for example, q'oI=d walš '200'). In such forms, only -d is used as a class marker as the numeral agrees with 'hundred' [155—156]. When denoting the number of thousands, the simple numeral is used in its full form, with =le (for example, q'oIlle millijon '2 000 000') [157].

In hundreds and thousands, numerals denoting the number of hundreds and thousands agree with the words 'hundred' / 'thousand' (class IV). In attributive function, if the noun is in the oblique case, numerals are in genitive (except for sa '1' which does not inflect in this case) [76]. About Kina dialect: «With the head in an oblique case, cardinal numerals occur in the attributive form with the suffix -dɨ» [mukhin2020: 7]. «In a complex numeral, only the last numeral agrees in gender with the head. Numerals weš ‘hundred’, haʁzɨr ‘thousand’ morphologically behave like nouns; they do not take any gender markers.
