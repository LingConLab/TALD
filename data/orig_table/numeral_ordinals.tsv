The ordinal numerals from 1 to 6 can also refer to the days of the weekýý. In oblique case, iýýýýu turns into iýýýýo [176]. Unlike [bokarev1959tsez: 202] for Tsez, the source here interprets iýýýýu as a morpheme, apparently, since it is written with a hyphen in the examples. ýýNote that the ordinal numeral hos-iýýýýu ýýýfirstýýý, unlike other ordinal numerals, is not used to modify an animate object, e.g. *hos-iýýýýu ýýik'o ýýýthe first manýýý, but hos-iýýýýu kanal ýýýthe first channelýýý. For animates, it is necessary to use the periphrastic construction with the adverbs heýý'ýý'e ýýýmostýýý and atýýuýýa ýýýin frontýýý, e.g. heýý'ýý'e atýýuýýasa ýýik'o ýýýthe first manýýý, meaning e.g. ýýýfirst in the lineýýýýý.

Only the numeral ýýýfirstýýý has the suppletive form iýý'ýý'a aldoýýos, whereby iýý'ýý'a is a degree adverb with the meaning ýýýveryýýý, and aldoýýos is an adjective derived from the adverb/postposition aldoýýos ýýýbefore, forward, in frontýýý. In addition to the native word for ýýýfirstýýý the Avar loans t'occebesew/t'occebeseb and awalaw are also usedýý. -no is saved in all parts of a complex numeral.
