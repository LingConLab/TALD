There is debate whether there is a trace of genitive marker in this -imʤi or if it a full borrowing from Azeri. Anyway, ordinals are considered to be «young» in Udi. Dictionary in [mobili2010] has examples of -umʤi (for example, q'a-umʤi '20th' [187]). [mobili2010: 330] also gives an example саун (glossed one-GEN) and translates it as 'first'.

The circumfix is also used to make «agent-nouns from nominal roots». «The exception is ‘first’, which is p’ir+v+el-i; however, the expected form me-ert-e is possible as an alternative (actually recommended by The Norms) for compound ordinals with ‘first’ as their final component».
