In Zilo and other Upper dialects, -čʼigu can no longer be separated and neither element appears with the meaning it presumably had (negation or converb) in any other context (see Verhees (2019) for a more detailed discussion of the diachrony of -č'igu).” The prohibitive marker is formed upon the future imperative through the prefixation of the negation marker sːu- reduced to s- (arχ-inn-e-s-qo ‘don't open’) [22].	ruƛi-rado-sːu			is saying	say-PROG-NEG	kayeetaldraft2020	23		Maksim Melenchenko	2024-07-09T00:00:00Z

In non-finite forms, it is prefixal (prefix is inserted after the preverb) or infixal. The same affix -dar- is used as both prefix and suffix, sometimes with variations (-idar for future), as a prefix it undergoes vowel harmony (dVr-), as an infix it becomes -drV-. In trisyllabic verbs with preverbs negation is expressed by reduplication of the second syllable. Prohibitive mV- is used for the second person. Negative auxiliary (dayi for eventual past, but affixation can also be used [the distribution is unclear]) is used in analytic tense [babaliyeva2013].	гъафун-дар-за		я не пришёл	I did not come	come-NEG-1SG	alekseevshixalieva2003	69		Maksim Melenchenko	2024-07-09T00:00:00Z

Prohibitive is derived the same way but with -(i)m instead of -(i)dʲ. Analytic negated forms are derived by negating either the lexical verb or the auxiliary. Negated forms can be derived from any analytic or synthetic form by juxtaposition of the indicative form with the particle deš.	q<idʲ>aˤ=t’=q’ɨn			has not feared	PV<NEG>=4=be_afraid.PFV	kibrik1999	81		Maksim Melenchenko	2024-07-09T00:00:00Z
