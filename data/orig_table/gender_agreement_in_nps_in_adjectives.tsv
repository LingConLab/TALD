However, it is also said that the class suffix is omitted in the majority of cases in NPs (so adjectives modifying a noun are described as agreeing in class (p. 66), but with the suffix class marker omitted (in most cases, p. 40)). I am not sure how to best describe this. Also value6: it is stated that one group of adjectives lacks a class marker, the remaining adjectives have class markers.	Alina Khurges	01.09.2025
