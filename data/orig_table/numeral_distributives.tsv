The second method is reduplication. Mostly the first syllable (CV) is reduplicated, but it also possible to reduplicate the first CVC or CVCV segment. The copy always preceded the base. Numerals with a root that is longer than CV can have several reduplicated forms that occur in free variation, e.g. ocýýýeno ýýýtenýýý has several variants of distributive numerals: o-oc'eno, ocýýý-oc'eno, and oc'e-oc'eno can be formed from the root oc'e-ýý.
ýýIn addition, both methods (i.e. reduplication and the use of the ILOC-Essive suffix) can be combined.
