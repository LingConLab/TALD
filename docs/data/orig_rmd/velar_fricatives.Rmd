The presence of velar fricatives is a complicated feature, since many Russian scholars tend to merge the voiced velar fricative *ɣ* and voiced velar stop *ɡ*. Sometimes the voiced velar fricative is mixed (or positionally distributed) with the voiced uvular fricative *ʁ*, and, as a result, scholars provide a merged velar-uvular place of articulation or choose one of them.

[Table 1](#t1) below shows the inventories of velar fricatives. As we can see from the table as well as the map, the most common inventory is just *x*. There are 11 languages that lack velar fricatives, including all non-East Caucasian languages (except Azerbaijani). Eight languages have both voiced and voiceless fricatives. Other systems are rare.
